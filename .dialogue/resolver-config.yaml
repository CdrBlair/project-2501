# Resolver Configuration
# Defines where different artifact types are located in this project

# NOTE: This config file exists for future use. Currently the resolver
# uses hardcoded defaults. Proper YAML parsing requires yq or similar.

#   THY/REF/STR documents: docs/
#   ADR documents: decisions/
#   Logs: .dialogue/logs/
#   Work items: .dialogue/work-items.yaml
