  Extend I-3 (Naur-Wegner Integration) with functional actor roles section.

  Gap identified: C-4 defines actor *types* (Human vs AI) and C-5 defines
  collaboration *patterns*, but neither defines functional *roles* that
  operationalise how actors perform TMS operations through dialogue.

  Functional roles to define:
  - Facilitator: Structures dialogue, prompts articulation (directory updates, encoding)
  - Synthesiser: Integrates information, proposes understanding (encoding, coordination)
  - Validator: Tests understanding, confirms accuracy (retrieval, credibility)
  - Scribe: Captures and preserves outputs (externalisation, PRESERVE)
  - Researcher: Retrieves external information (retrieval from external sources)

  Key insight: Roles are independent of actor type. Both humans and AI can fill
  them with different strengths. AI doesn't need to hold tacit knowledge to help
  humans externalise it (Facilitator role).

  Extension should add to I-3:
  - Functional role definitions (distinct from organisational roles per C-4)
  - Role-TMS operation mapping
  - Actor-role suitability guidance
  - Phase-role relevance

  NOTE: Remove existing reference to THY-003 from I-3 - relationship flows wrong way.
objective: "I-3 extended with functional actor roles that operationalise TMS participation"
rationale: |
  SH-009 (Phase 1 Capability Flows) needs to specify *which roles* perform each step,
  not just "Human" or "AI". This fills the operationalisation gap between actor types
  and collaboration patterns.

  Created 14 January 2026 from actor-concept integration investigation.
  Logged as OBS-20260114-165512.

  Completed 14 January 2026:
  - Extended I-3 (integration_naur-wegner.md) with "Functional Actor Roles in TMS Operations" section
  - Defined five roles: Facilitator, Synthesiser, Validator, Scribe, Researcher
  - Added role-TMS operation mapping table
  - Added role-actor suitability table (human vs AI strengths)
  - Added role-phase relevance table
  - Connected roles to collaboration patterns for operationalisation
  - Removed inappropriate THY-003 reference (theory docs shouldn't be referenced as sources)
  - Updated Integration with Other Concepts section
  - Updated Validation Status with role-related items
  - Document history updated to Version 3.0
