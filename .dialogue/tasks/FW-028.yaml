description: |
  Design and implement a graph/network model for tracing problem domain elements (theories, requirements, decisions, implementations, tests) and their relationships. Enables queries like 'Is this theory validated?' and 'What supports this decision?'. Storage in .dialogue/project/ as files initially, with potential for other storage backends later.
objective: "Graph-based traceability model enabling queries across theories, requirements, implementations, and validations"
rationale: |
  Assessment infrastructure (FW-023) needs an underlying model to make assessments meaningful. Traceability enables answering whether theories are proved, requirements met, and identifying gaps. Spawned from FW-023 discussion.
