title: "Problem Domain Traceability Model"

type: CAPABILITY
priority: HIGH
description: |
  Design and implement a graph/network model for tracing problem domain elements (theories, requirements, decisions, implementations, tests) and their relationships. Enables queries like 'Is this theory validated?' and 'What supports this decision?'. Storage in .dialogue/context-graph/ as files initially (directory+instance pattern), with potential for other storage backends later. Extends existing context graph schema with traceability edges.
objective: "Graph-based traceability model enabling queries across theories, requirements, implementations, and validations"
rationale: |
  Assessment infrastructure (FW-023) needs an underlying model to make assessments meaningful. Traceability enables answering whether theories are proved, requirements met, and identifying gaps. Spawned from FW-023 discussion.

  Progress 21 January 2026:
  - Updated schema_context-graph.md with:
    - Traceability edges (VALIDATES, ASSUMES, SATISFIES, SPECIFIES, TESTS, COVERS, DEPENDS_ON)
    - New artifact types (ASSUMPTION, REQUIREMENT, TEST, IMPLEMENTATION)
    - Directory+instance storage pattern (DEC-20260121-133941)
    - Traceability queries and consistency rules
  - Bootstrapped context graph for self-hosting:
    - Created .dialogue/context-graph/ directory structure
    - 31 artifact nodes (THY-*, REF-*, STR-*, F-*, C-*, O-*, I-*, G-*, E-*)
    - 2 actor nodes (human:pidster, ai:claude)
    - 10 edges (authorship and concept relationships)
    - Bootstrap scripts in scripts/ subdirectory
  - Created FW-031 for deferred negative edges (CONTRADICTS, RISKS)

  Remaining work:
  - Bootstrap decision/observation/task nodes (scripted, lower priority)
  - More edges between concepts (can be added incrementally)
  - Query implementation (TMS operations)
