type: CAPABILITY
phase: 5
priority: MEDIUM
description: |
  Operationalise Phase 5 (Implementation) guidance and capability flows.

  Phase characteristics:
  - Information composition: 60% formal, 25% tacit, 15% emergent
  - Key capabilities: Transform, Generate, Validate, Preserve
  - Collaboration patterns: AI-Led, AI-Only (with human review)
  - Key outputs: Source code, unit tests, technical documentation

  Tasks:
  1. Define Phase 5 processes in framework-manual.md:
     - PROC-5.1: Code Generation
     - PROC-5.2: Unit Testing
     - PROC-5.3: Code Review
     - PROC-5.4: Technical Documentation
  2. Specify capability instances, roles, patterns, triggers
  3. Create/update AI configuration for Phase 5 behaviour

objective: "Phase 5 guidance and capability flows operationalised"
rationale: |
  Implementation is where AI can contribute most directly.
  High formal knowledge enables AI-Led/AI-Only patterns.

  Created 19 January 2026 as placeholder.
  Placeholder task - details TBD based on earlier phase learnings.
  This phase aligns well with current AI coding capabilities.
