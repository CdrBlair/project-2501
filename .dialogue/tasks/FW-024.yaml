description: |
  Review remaining schemas in implementation/ and determine whether they should
  move into claude-plugin-evo.

  ## Current State

  **Schemas in implementation/ (10 files):**
  - schema_environment-capability-registry.md
  - schema_document-frontmatter.md
  - schema_information-reference.md
  - schema_context-graph.md
  - schema_execution-log.md
  - schema_resolver-interface.md
  - schema_deployment-model.md
  - schema_process-definition.md
  - schema_process-instance.md
  - schema_tasks.md

  **Schemas already in claude-plugin-evo/references/ (3 files):**
  - schema_execution-log.md
  - schema_process-instance.md
  - schema_process-definition.md

  **Also in plugin:**
  - skills/dialogue-manage-tasks/schema.md (task schema)

  ## Questions to Resolve

  1. Are the plugin copies canonical, making implementation/ copies stale?
  2. Which remaining schemas are needed for plugin operation?
  3. Which schemas are framework development artifacts (stay in implementation/)?
  4. Should implementation/ retain source versions with cross-references?

  ## Candidate Schemas for Migration

  Likely candidates (needed for plugin operation):
  - schema_document-frontmatter.md (if plugin creates documents)
  - schema_information-reference.md (if plugin resolves references)

  Likely to stay (framework development artifacts):
  - schema_environment-capability-registry.md
  - schema_deployment-model.md
  - schema_context-graph.md (unless plugin uses context graphs)
  - schema_resolver-interface.md

  Unclear:
  - schema_tasks.md (relationship to dialogue-manage-tasks/schema.md?)

objective: "Clear decision on each schema: migrate to plugin, keep in implementation/, or deprecate"
rationale: |
  Plugin should be standalone and portable. Schemas needed for plugin operation
  should live in the plugin. Framework development schemas should stay in
  implementation/. Duplicates create maintenance burden and confusion.

  Created 20 January 2026.

  Related to FW-019 (plugin rename) and FW-021 (verify plugin standalone).
  Some schemas may have already been migrated; need to check for duplicates.

  Completed 21 January 2026:

  Final disposition:
  - **Migrated to plugin** (3): document-frontmatter, information-reference, resolver-interface
  - **Kept in implementation/** (4): context-graph, deployment-model, environment-capability-registry, tasks
  - **Removed from implementation/** (6): 3 duplicates + 3 migrated

  Plugin now contains 6 schemas in references/:
  - schema_document-frontmatter.md
  - schema_execution-log.md
  - schema_information-reference.md
  - schema_process-definition.md
  - schema_process-instance.md
  - schema_resolver-interface.md

  implementation/ retains 4 schemas (framework development artifacts):
  - schema_context-graph.md (future capability)
  - schema_deployment-model.md (meta-documentation)
  - schema_environment-capability-registry.md (tool comparison)
  - schema_tasks.md (historical, marked INACTIVE)

  Decision logged as DEC-20260121-090151
