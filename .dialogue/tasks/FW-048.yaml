  Review all files in claude-plugin-evo/rules/ and verify they have correct frontmatter with paths. Rules without frontmatter need user guidance. Rules with frontmatter should match one path only to minimise context consumption.

  Completed 26 January 2026:

  Reviewed 9 rule files in claude-plugin-evo/rules/:

  1. Split dialogue-path-operations.md (6 paths) into 4 single-path files:
     - dialogue-tasks-operations.md (.dialogue/tasks/**/*)
     - dialogue-decisions-operations.md (.dialogue/logs/decisions/**/*)
     - dialogue-observations-operations.md (.dialogue/logs/observations/**/*)
     - dialogue-users-operations.md (.dialogue/users/**/*)

  2. Created 8 review tasks for rules without frontmatter:
     - DOC-006: phase1-initiation.md
     - DOC-007: phase2-planning.md
     - DOC-008: phase3-analysis.md
     - DOC-009: phase4-design.md
     - DOC-010: phase5-implementation.md
     - DOC-011: phase6-testing.md
     - DOC-012: phase7-deployment.md
     - DOC-013: actor-context-awareness.md

  Result: All rules now either have single-path frontmatter or are queued for review.
