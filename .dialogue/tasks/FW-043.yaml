description: |
  During framework initialisation or first use, detect current user and add to project configuration if not already present. Supports multi-user tracking (FW-040) and enables user-specific session memos.
objective: "Users are automatically registered with the framework on first interaction"
rationale: |
  Current init doesn't capture user identity; needed for multi-user awareness and personalisation
