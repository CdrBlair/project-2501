description: |
  Design and implement mechanism for orchestrator to hand off process
  definitions to subagents for execution.

  Considerations:
  - How process definition travels (inline vs file reference)
  - Context passing (what else subagent needs)
  - Task tool integration
  - Subagent type selection

objective: "Orchestrator can spawn subagent with process definition"
rationale: "Enables orchestrator-composed, subagent-executed pattern"
