notes: |
  Completed 14 January 2026.
  Created schema_information-reference.md (Version 2 - simplified):
  - Self-describing IDs: pattern determines type (no scheme prefixes needed)
  - Document patterns: THY-NNN, REF-NNN, STR-NNN, F-N, C-N, O-N, I-N, G-N, E-N
  - Timestamp patterns: DEC-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS, OBS-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
  - task patterns: SH-NNN, CD-NNN, FW-NNN
  - Actor patterns: human:<id>, ai:<id>
  - Version suffix: @vN, Fragment suffix: #section
  - Relationship types aligned with document frontmatter schema
  - Resolution deferred to SH-002 (location-agnostic design)
