  Design machine-interpretable process definition schema for subagent execution.

  Architecture (per DEC-20260115-173132):
  - Standalone YAML process definition files in plugin/processes/
  - Generic process-executor agent loads and executes
  - Task tool invocation for subagent execution
  - User doesn't need to know framework internals

  Schema components:
  1. ProcessDefinition: Reusable template (well-known processes)
     - Steps (YAML): Capability instance details, actor patterns, escalation triggers
     - Flow (Mermaid): Control structure for non-linear processes
  2. ProcessInstance: Execution plan (intent)
     - References definition (or inline for dynamic)
     - Bound inputs, expected steps, success criteria
  3. ExecutionLog: Links to DEC-*/OBS-* entries (actuality)

  Key separation: Intent (ProcessInstance) vs Actuality (ExecutionLog)
  Enables: Plan review before execution, comparison after

objective: "Schema enables orchestrator to compose processes that subagents can execute"
rationale: "Core schema for dynamic process creation capability"

  Builds on FW-012 gap analysis.

  15 January 2026: Unblocked by FW-012 completion.
  Key inputs: OBS-20260115-154205 (Mermaid), OBS-20260115-154312 (gap analysis).

  15 January 2026: Architecture decided (DEC-20260115-173132):
  - Hybrid model: standalone definitions + generic executor agent + Task tool
  - Intent/Actuality separation: ProcessInstance (plan) vs ExecutionLog (audit)
  - User experience priority: Claude handles process selection
