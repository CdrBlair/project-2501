  Address conceptual debt identified in THY-003:
  - AI capability temporal qualification
  - Context Engineering provenance
  - Boundary sharpening (TMS/theory, validation/verification)
  - Evidence tier gaps
  - Observability vs measurement distinction
objective: "THY-003 debt items addressed or explicitly deferred"

  Progress 14 January 2026:

  THY-003 Conversation-as-TMS conceptual debt RESOLVED:
  - F-2 extended with "Conversation as the TMS Mechanism" section
  - F-2 extended with "The Ephemeral Context Problem" section
  - I-3 extended with "Conversation Builds Both Theory and TMS" section
  - I-3 extended with "Human-AI TMS Asymmetry" section
  - THY-003 status changed from PROVISIONAL to ACCEPTED

  Remaining items (from original description) need review:
  - AI capability temporal qualification
  - Context Engineering provenance
  - Boundary sharpening (TMS/theory, validation/verification)
  - Evidence tier gaps
  - Observability vs measurement distinction

  Note: Referenced file theory_thy-003-conceptual-debt.md does not exist.
  Need to create or locate full inventory.
