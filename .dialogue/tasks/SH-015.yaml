status: COMPLETED

type: CAPABILITY
phase: 6
priority: MEDIUM
description: |
  Operationalise Phase 6 (Testing & Integration) guidance and capability flows.

  Phase characteristics:
  - Information composition: 65% formal, 20% tacit, 15% emergent
  - Key capabilities: Validate, Analyse, Preserve
  - Collaboration patterns: AI-Led, AI-Only
  - Key outputs: Test results, integration reports, quality metrics

  Tasks:
  1. Define Phase 6 processes in framework-manual.md:
     - PROC-6.1: Simple Validation (exists as sample)
     - PROC-6.2: Integration Testing
     - PROC-6.3: System Testing
     - PROC-6.4: Quality Reporting
  2. Specify capability instances, roles, patterns, triggers
  3. Create/update AI configuration for Phase 6 behaviour

objective: "Phase 6 guidance and capability flows operationalised"
rationale: |
  Testing is highly automatable with clear pass/fail criteria.
  process-simple-validation.yaml provides starting template.

notes: |
  Created 19 January 2026 as placeholder.

  COMPLETED 20 January 2026:
  - Updated PROC-6.1 (Simple Validation) with references and corrected info composition
  - Created PROC-6.2 (Integration Testing)
  - Created PROC-6.3 (System Testing)
  - Created PROC-6.4 (Quality Reporting)
  - Created plugin/rules/phase6-testing.md for AI behaviour
  - All processes follow QUICK/FULL modes per PRI-001
  - Highest formal content (65%) - AI-Only for mechanical execution
  - AI-Led dominant for analysis; Human-Led for release decisions only
  - Validate capability dominates this phase
