type: CAPABILITY
phase: 4
priority: MEDIUM
description: |
  Operationalise Phase 4 (Design) guidance and capability flows.

  Phase characteristics:
  - Information composition: 50% formal, 30% tacit, 20% emergent
  - Key capabilities: Analyse, Synthesise, Transform, Decide
  - Collaboration patterns: Partnership, AI-Led
  - Key outputs: Architecture docs, interface specs, data designs

  Tasks:
  1. Define Phase 4 processes in framework-manual.md:
     - PROC-4.1: Architecture Design
     - PROC-4.2: Interface Design
     - PROC-4.3: Data Design
     - PROC-4.4: Design Review
  2. Specify capability instances, roles, patterns, triggers
  3. Create/update AI configuration for Phase 4 behaviour

objective: "Phase 4 guidance and capability flows operationalised"
rationale: |
  Design phase transforms requirements into technical specifications.
  AI assistance becomes more viable as formal knowledge increases.
