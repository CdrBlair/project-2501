description: |
  Define abstract resolver interface for information retrieval.
  Create filesystem implementation as first concrete implementation.
objective: "Resolver interface defined; filesystem implementation working"
rationale: "Enables location-agnostic information access"
blocked_by: []
blocks: ["SH-003"]
notes: |
  Completed 14 January 2026.
  Created:
  - implementation/schema_resolver-interface.md — Abstract interface contract
  - .claude/skills/dialogue-resolve-reference/SKILL.md — Skill definition
  - .claude/skills/dialogue-resolve-reference/scripts/resolve-reference.sh — Filesystem implementation

  Runtime artifact resolution (what deployments have access to):
  - Project docs: THY-NNN, REF-NNN, STR-NNN, ADR-NNN (in implementation/, decisions/)
  - Log entries: DEC-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS, OBS-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
  - tasks: SH-NNN, CD-NNN, FW-NNN
  - Actors: human:<id>, ai:<id>
  - External URLs: Returns EXTERNAL status (use WebFetch)

  Framework source references (F-N, C-N, I-N, G-N, E-N):
  - NOT resolvable by deployed framework — these are framework source docs
  - Returns NOT_SUPPORTED status directing to framework documentation
  - See FW-005 for deployment artifact definition

  Output formats: full (content), metadata (location only), path (just file path)
  TMS alignment: Implements retrieval operation for Context Graph
