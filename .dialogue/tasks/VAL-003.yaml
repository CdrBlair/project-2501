  Address collaboration pattern boundary operationalisation gap.

  C-5 defines five patterns but extreme boundaries are vague:
  - Human-Only: "AI cannot contribute value" — what criteria determine this?
  - AI-Only: "Human review adds no value" — when is this actually true?

  Middle boundaries (Human-Led ↔ Partnership ↔ AI-Led) are clearer.

  Tasks:
  1. Develop operational criteria or decision trees for boundary determination
  2. Consider: information type, risk level, accountability requirements
  3. Cross-reference with capability model (which capabilities ever qualify for AI-Only?)
  4. Update C-5 with sharper boundary definitions or acknowledge irreducible ambiguity
objective: "C-5 pattern boundaries operationalised or irreducible ambiguity acknowledged"
rationale: |
  Practitioners need to know which pattern to use. Vague boundaries
  undermine the practical value of the pattern taxonomy.
