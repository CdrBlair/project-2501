  Design and implement operational infrastructure for collecting, preserving,
  referencing, and acting on the assessments defined in C-6 and C-7.

  ## Context

  CD-002 and CD-003 added operationalised guidance to C-6 (transition mitigations)
  and C-7 (early-phase measurement). However, the operational machinery for
  actually collecting, preserving, referencing, and acting on this information
  has gaps.

  ## Current State

  | Function | What We Have | Gaps |
  |----------|--------------|------|
  | Collect | log-decision, log-observation | No structured assessment collection |
  | Preserve | Decision/observation logs; document types | No assessment artifacts; no trends |
  | Reference | Document IDs; resolve-reference | No structured retrieval for assessments |
  | Act | Task management; decision logging | No phase gate workflows; no escalation |

  ## What C-6/C-7 Now Prescribe (but can't operationally support)

  - Stakeholder alignment surveys (5 dimensions, 1-5 scale)
  - Problem framing checklists (6 elements)
  - TTKM-adapted assessments (5 constructs)
  - Good/bad day indicators (daily check-ins)
  - Review outcomes tracking
  - Phase transition readiness determination
  - Threshold-based escalation

  ## Options Identified

  ### Option A: Minimal — Document-Based
  Use existing document types with conventions. Manual structure, grep-based reference.
  - Pros: No new tooling
  - Cons: High friction; inconsistent; no computed scores

  ### Option B: Moderate — Assessment Skills
  Create new skills for structured assessment:
  - assess-stakeholder-alignment
  - assess-problem-framing
  - check-phase-readiness
  - Pros: Structured; consistent; reduced friction
  - Cons: New skills to build; still manual triggering

  ### Option C: Full — Assessment Framework
  Build comprehensive infrastructure with assessment document type, registry,
  trend analysis, cross-project learning.
  - Pros: Complete operational support
  - Cons: Significant effort; may be over-engineering

  ## Open Questions (require further discussion)

  1. **Friction tolerance**: How much manual effort is acceptable?
     - Daily check-ins require low friction
     - Phase gate reviews can tolerate more
     - Consider progressive revelation of features

  2. **Trend analysis priority**: Do we need trends over time, or is
     point-in-time assessment sufficient for now?
     - Progressive revelation may apply here too

  3. **Integration depth**: Should assessments block, inform, or just provide visibility?
     - Current thinking: "inform decisions" (soft recommendations)
     - Hard gates may be appropriate later

  ## Approach

  Self-hosting first: implement for the framework project itself as validation,
  then generalise for projects adopting the framework.

  ## Tasks

  1. Resolve open questions through structured discussion
  2. Select option (likely B with path to C)
  3. Design assessment document type or logging conventions
  4. Implement priority assessment skills
  5. Define phase gate workflow (even if manual initially)
  6. Test on framework project (self-hosting)
  7. Document patterns for general use

objective: "Operational infrastructure enabling collection, preservation, reference, and action on C-6/C-7 assessments"
rationale: |
  C-6 and C-7 now contain operationalised guidance but no operational machinery
  to use it. Without collection/action infrastructure, the guidance remains
  theoretical. Self-hosting validates the approach before generalising.

notes: |
  Created 20 January 2026 from CD-002/CD-003 completion discussion.

  Key insight: The framework now prescribes what to measure and how to mitigate,
  but lacks the plumbing to actually do it. This is the next layer of work.

  Decision: Start with self-hosting (framework project) as validation step.
  Decision: Integration depth should be "inform" not "block" initially.
  Open: Friction tolerance and progressive revelation need discussion.
  Open: Trend analysis priority needs discussion.
