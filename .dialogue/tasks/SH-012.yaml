type: CAPABILITY
phase: 3
priority: MEDIUM
description: |
  Operationalise Phase 3 (Analysis) guidance and capability flows.

  Phase characteristics:
  - Information composition: 40% formal, 35% tacit, 25% emergent
  - Key capabilities: Elicit, Analyse, Synthesise, Validate
  - Collaboration patterns: Human-Led, Partnership
  - Key outputs: Requirements specs, use cases, data models

  Tasks:
  1. Define Phase 3 processes in framework-manual.md:
     - PROC-3.1: Requirements Elicitation
     - PROC-3.2: Requirements Analysis
     - PROC-3.3: Requirements Validation
     - PROC-3.4: Requirements Documentation
  2. Specify capability instances, roles, patterns, triggers
  3. Create/update AI configuration for Phase 3 behaviour

objective: "Phase 3 guidance and capability flows operationalised"
rationale: |
  Analysis phase bridges tacit-heavy planning to design.
  Requirements quality directly impacts downstream phases.
