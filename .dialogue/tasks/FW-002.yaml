type: SCHEMA
priority: LOW
description: |
  Review and refine the task tracking approach after gaining experience:
  - Evaluate schema completeness against actual usage patterns
  - Consider additional fields or simplifications
  - Assess persistence mechanism (file-based vs alternatives)
  - Review TodoWrite integration effectiveness
  - Consider tooling for task management (list, filter, update commands)
objective: "task schema and persistence validated or improved based on experience"
rationale: "Initial schema was designed speculatively; real usage will reveal improvements"
