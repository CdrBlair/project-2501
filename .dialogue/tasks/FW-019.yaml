  Rename the 'plugin' directory to 'claude-plugin-evo' and update all
  references throughout the codebase.

  Tasks:
  1. Rename plugin/ to claude-plugin-evo/
  2. Update all internal references:
     - Process definition references to rules files
     - Schema documentation paths
     - CLAUDE.md references
     - Framework manual references
     - Cross-references in concept documents
  3. Update any relative paths in YAML files
  4. Verify no broken references remain
  5. Update WHAT_IS_THIS.md if needed

  Files likely affected:
  - All plugin/processes/*.yaml (references section)
  - implementation/schema_process-definition.md
  - implementation/framework-manual-source.md
  - .claude/CLAUDE.md
  - concepts/*.md (any plugin/ references)

objective: "Plugin directory renamed with all references updated"
rationale: |
  The name 'claude-plugin-evo' better reflects the purpose and evolution
  of this component as a Claude Code plugin implementation.
