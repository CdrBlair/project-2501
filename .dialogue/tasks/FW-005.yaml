  Define what constitutes a framework deployment vs framework source.
objective: "Clear deployment model with configurable artifact locations"
rationale: "Resolver currently hardcodes paths that won't exist in deployments"

  Completed 14 January 2026.
  Created implementation/schema_deployment-model.md defining:

  Three-Tier Artifact Model:
  1. Framework Source (NOT deployed): concepts/, papers/, research/
     - Reference patterns F-N, C-N, I-N, G-N, E-N return NOT_SUPPORTED
     - Access via web docs or framework repository clone

  2. Deployment Artifacts (distributed): .claude/, .dialogue/, decisions/
     - Skills, agents, commands, logging infrastructure
     - Copied/installed to projects using framework

  3. Project Artifacts (created at runtime): decisions/ADR-*, .dialogue/logs/
     - THY, REF, STR documents in configured location
     - Decisions, observations, tasks

  Configuration mechanism:
  - .dialogue/config.yaml defines artifact locations
  - Defaults: docs/ for THY/REF/STR, decisions/ for ADR
  - Framework dev override: implementation/ (this project)
  - Config parsing TODO: needs yq or similar

  Key decisions:
  - Framework source not bundled (too large, changes independently)
  - Web documentation recommended for framework source access
  - Configuration allows projects to use any directory structure
