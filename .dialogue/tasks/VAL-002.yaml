  Investigate the TMS requirements scaling claim in I-2.

  Current claim: "Phases with higher tacit composition require more robust
  actor-routing mechanisms (TMS infrastructure)"

  This is logically derived but empirically untested. Tasks:
  1. Review TMS literature for phase-specific evidence
  2. Check if Ryan & O'Connor's measure shows phase correlation
  3. Consider what validation would look like (comparative TMS effectiveness studies)
  4. Either find supporting evidence, acknowledge as hypothesis, or revise

  Marked ⚠ in I-2 validation status; need to either resolve or make uncertainty explicit.
objective: "I-2 TMS scaling claim validated with evidence or marked as hypothesis"
rationale: |
  Framework presents logical derivation as if validated. Need to distinguish
  "logically coherent" from "empirically supported" for practitioner trust.
