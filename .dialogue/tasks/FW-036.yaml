description: |
  Design and implement background agents that perform ongoing framework operations: monitoring (e.g., context graph consistency, log compliance), validation (e.g., schema conformance, reference integrity), and other autonomous tasks. Consider how these agents report findings and escalate issues.
objective: "Autonomous agents that maintain framework health and surface issues without explicit user invocation"
rationale: |
  Proactive monitoring catches problems early and reduces cognitive load on users to remember validation steps
