description: |
  Implement health monitoring assessment skills for stakeholder alignment and
  team tacit knowledge. These provide visibility into project health but do not
  gate framework execution.

  ## Skills to Implement

  ### dialogue-assess-alignment
  Stakeholder alignment assessment (5 dimensions, 1-5 scale):
  - goal_clarity: "We agree on what success looks like"
  - priority_alignment: "We agree on what matters most"
  - risk_awareness: "We share understanding of risks"
  - communication_quality: "Information flows effectively"
  - decision_authority: "We agree on who decides what"

  ### dialogue-assess-ttkm
  Team Tacit Knowledge Measure constructs (Ryan & O'Connor, 2013):
  - shared_understanding: "Team members understand each other's work"
  - knowledge_location: "We know who knows what"
  - knowledge_access: "We can easily get knowledge from each other"
  - knowledge_integration: "We effectively combine our knowledge"
  - knowledge_creation: "We create new knowledge together"

  ## Design Notes

  - Schema already defined in FW-023's assessment schema document
  - Follow same patterns as dialogue-daily-check
  - Suggested frequency: alignment monthly or at phase transitions; TTKM quarterly
  - These are diagnostic tools, not execution gates

  ## Framework Grounding

  - Stakeholder alignment: TMS theory, STS joint optimisation
  - TTKM: Ryan & O'Connor (C-5), Wegner's transactive memory

objective: "Visibility into stakeholder alignment and team knowledge health"
rationale: |
  Split from FW-023 to separate execution-critical assessments (daily check,
  problem framing, phase readiness) from health monitoring assessments. These
  are valuable for diagnosing project issues but don't block framework operation.
blocked_by:
  - FW-023  # Assessment infrastructure must exist first
blocks: []
notes: |
  Created 22 January 2026, split from FW-023 Phase 2.

  Decision: DEC-20260122-130000 - Defer alignment and TTKM assessments as they
  are health monitoring (visibility) rather than execution gates.
