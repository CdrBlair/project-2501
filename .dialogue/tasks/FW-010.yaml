  Improve registry_claude-code.yaml with:

  1. Environment variables reference:
     - Document available environment variables (CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT, etc.)
     - Note which variables are available in which contexts (hooks, skills, scripts)
     - Skill scripts should use these instead of hardcoded paths

  2. Path-filtering configuration clarity:
     - Improve description of how rules path-matching works
     - Clarify relationship between globs patterns and rule activation
     - Document when to use rules vs skills vs manual guidance

  Gap identified: Skill scripts currently don't use available environment variables,
  and registry doesn't document them clearly.
objective: "Registry documents environment variables and clarifies path-filtering config"
rationale: |
  Environment variables enable portable, context-aware scripts.
  Current scripts hardcode paths that may not work in all contexts.
  OBS-20260115-085039 records the gap.
