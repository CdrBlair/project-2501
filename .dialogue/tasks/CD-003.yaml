description: |
  Address transition mitigation gap for early phases.

  C-6 (Transitions & Information Loss) quantifies 35-45% loss at Initiation→Planning,
  40-50% at Planning→Analysis, but doesn't provide phase-specific mitigation strategies.

  Later phases have ADRs (Design→Implementation) mentioned. Early phases need equivalent.

  Tasks:
  1. Identify what specific tacit knowledge is lost at Initiation→Planning
  2. Research or develop mitigation practices for early-phase transitions
  3. Consider: stakeholder continuity, rationale capture, decision logging, context preservation
  4. Update C-6 with phase-specific mitigation guidance
  5. Cross-reference with dialogue skills (log-decision, log-observation) as mitigation tools

  Framework's own concepts predict early-phase mitigation has highest value
  because tacit loss is greatest there.
objective: "C-6 updated with Phase 1-2 transition mitigation strategies"
rationale: |
  Highest-value mitigation opportunities are in early phases where tacit loss
  is greatest, yet guidance focuses on later phases. This is backwards per
  framework's own information composition model.

  Created 14 January 2026 from Phase 1-2 analysis.
  May connect to dialogue skills as concrete mitigation implementations.
