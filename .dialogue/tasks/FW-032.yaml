title: "Revisit soft gates after assessment testing"

type: CAPABILITY
priority: MEDIUM
description: |
  After FW-023 assessment infrastructure is implemented and tested, revisit soft gate integration for phase transitions. Soft gates capture user decision to proceed at risk, enabling conscious information debt tracking per C-8 principles.
objective: "Determine which transitions need soft gates to capture proceed-at-risk decisions"
rationale: |
  Soft gates are the mechanism for making information debt conscious and tracked. Further analysis needed after experimentation with assessment infrastructure.
