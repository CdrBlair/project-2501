description: |
  Research an SDLC project orchestrator for human-user-interface interaction
  and activity orchestration.

  **Scope (narrowed per DEC-20260115-083726)**:
  - How should human input be routed to appropriate framework activities?
  - How should the orchestrator delegate to specialised agents?
  - This is about the user-interface layer, NOT about how actors work within phases

  **Explicitly out of scope**:
  - Replacing the "actors emerge from configuration" model (SH-008)
  - Defining how actors operate within phases
  - Making architectural commitments at this stage

  **Open questions for research**:
  1. What is the orchestrator's responsibility boundary?
     - Route human input to appropriate phase/activity?
     - Maintain awareness of project state and context?

  2. How do specialised agents relate to the orchestrator?
     - Task tool spawning?
     - What context do they need?

  3. How does this layer interact with the emergent actor model?
     - Orchestrator routes; actors within phases still emerge from configuration?
     - Two-layer model: orchestration layer + execution layer?

  **Key constraint**: No final assertions. This is exploratory research.

objective: "Research orchestrator pattern for human-AI interaction layer"
rationale: |
  The framework needs a way to handle human input and route it appropriately.
  This is distinct from how actors operate within phases (which may still
  emerge from configuration per SH-008 insight).

  Created 15 January 2026 from user observation OBS-20260115-083436.
  Scope narrowed per DEC-20260115-083726: focus on UI/orchestration layer only.

  Key user guidance: "actors may also emerge from configuration, orchestrating
  framework interactions is different to operating within the framework"

  This is research, not design commitment.

  === Sub-task Completed: FW-009 (Hooks Investigation) ===
  Key findings (DEC-20260115-084309):
  - Hooks are guards/lifecycle handlers, NOT orchestration primitives
  - All matching hooks run in PARALLEL (no sequential workflow)
  - Recommended pattern: Hooks for validation/enforcement, Subagents for delegation,
    Skills/commands for workflow, Claude's reasoning for routing

  === Thought Experiment: Plugin Delivery Model (15 January 2026) ===
  Explored Claude Code Plugin as framework delivery mechanism.

  Hook events mapped to framework purposes:
  - SessionStart: Restore TMS context (retrieval operation)
  - SessionEnd: Create session memo (externalisation operation)
  - PreToolUse: Phase constraint validation?
  - PostToolUse: Auto-capture significant actions as observations?
  - Stop: Intelligent continuation decisions
  - UserPromptSubmit: Context injection based on detected intent

  Session Continuity Pattern (SessionStart + SessionEnd):
  - SessionEnd creates structured memo: active tasks, recent decisions/observations,
    phase context, open questions
  - SessionStart reads memo, presents project state (phase-independent per C-3 v2.0)
  - Addresses ephemeral context problem through TMS externalisation/retrieval

  Key insight (OBS-20260115-091213, DEC-20260115-092904):
  - Phases have implied linearity but retrograde steps are valid process outcomes
  - SessionStart must be phase-independent (C-3 v2.0 retrograde navigation)
  - Framework should help NAVIGATE retrograde steps, not just trace them

  Decomposition insight:
  - Orchestration (routing human input) → Claude's reasoning + CLAUDE.md + skills
  - Session continuity (TMS persistence) → Hook-based automation (SessionStart/SessionEnd)
  - Guardrails (phase constraints) → Hook-based validation (PreToolUse, Stop)
  - Capture (preserving what happens) → Hook-based or manual (PostToolUse, skills)

  The "orchestrator agent" may be less necessary if hooks handle continuity
  and Claude's reasoning handles routing based on good context injection.

  Open questions remaining:
  1. Session memo format and location → addressed by FW-017 (per-user files)
  2. How to present phase-independent project state effectively

  === Task State Integration (16 January 2026) ===
  RESOLVED: SessionStart hook now injects in-progress task titles.

  Implementation (session-start.sh):
  - Extracts in-progress task IDs and titles from tasks.yaml
  - Injects into systemMessage: "2 in-progress [CD-001: Title;FW-011: Title], 6 ready"
  - Max 5 in-progress tasks shown (prevents message bloat)
  - Ready tasks remain count-only

  Design rationale:
  - In-progress tasks are immediately relevant context
  - Titles provide enough context without full descriptions
  - Ready tasks less urgent; count sufficient for awareness

  === Stop Hook Investigation (16 January 2026) ===
  Extensive testing of Stop hooks revealed key differences between hook types.

  Clarified understanding (corrects earlier assumptions):
  - Prompt-based hooks DO have transcript access (evaluator LLM sees conversation)
  - Command-based hooks can read transcript file via transcript_path in context
  - The difference is RESPONSE HANDLING, not access:
    * Prompt hook: reason displayed to user, Claude does not act on it
    * Command hook: reason fed back to Claude, triggers immediate action

  Implications for orchestration:
  - Prompt hooks COULD provide intelligent context-aware decisions
  - But currently the response isn't actionable (UX/integration gap, not capability gap)
  - If response handling improved, prompt hooks viable for:
    * Intelligent routing suggestions
    * Context-aware guardrails
    * Phase-appropriate guidance injection
  - For now, command hooks remain reliable for anything needing Claude action

  Related issues: GitHub #11786, #11610, #12667
  Decision: Stop hooks removed for now (DEC-20260116-142842)

  Updated open question 2: Prompt vs command hooks is now ANSWERED for current state
  (command hooks for actionable responses), but prompt hooks have future potential.
