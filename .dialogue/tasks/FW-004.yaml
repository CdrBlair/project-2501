description: |
  Create dialogue-create-adr skill for Architecture Decision Records:
  - Use template from guidance_implementation.md (Context, Decision, Alternatives, Consequences, Rationale)
  - Store ADRs as Standing documents in decisions/ directory (ADR-NNN-<title>.md)
  - Automatically create decision log entry with type=ADR and ref to ADR file
  - Support status lifecycle (Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated → Superseded)
  Framework grounding: ADRs are STR domain, Standing temporal class,
  attempting to capture embedded knowledge through formal alternatives analysis.
objective: "ADR skill creates Standing decision documents with decision log cross-reference"
rationale: "ADRs require more structure than log entries; cross-reference ensures decision log is complete audit trail"

  Completed 14 January 2026.
  - Created dialogue-create-adr skill with SKILL.md and create-adr.sh script
  - ADRs stored in decisions/ directory with ADR-NNN-<slug>.md naming
  - Automatic cross-reference to decision log with type=ADR and ref field
  - Tested: ADR-001 created for decision type hierarchy (DEC-20260114-102443)
  Key design decision (DEC-20260114-101710): ADR creation must also create
  decision log entry to maintain decision log as source of truth.
