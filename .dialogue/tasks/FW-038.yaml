description: |
  Determine what belongs in CLAUDE.md (always loaded) vs plugin (when present). Draft minimal bootstrap: project identity, framework signal, plugin pointer, collaboration mode, escalation triggers, key conventions.
objective: "Clean separation between essential bootstrap and operational detail"
rationale: |
  Current CLAUDE.md has significant content that may duplicate plugin; need clear layering

  Created 22 January 2026.

  23 January 2026: Added dependency on FW-008 (SDLC Project Orchestrator Research).

  23 January 2026: FW-008 completed. Key decisions informing this task:
  - DEC-20260123-181128: Two modes (Evolution/Revolution), each with own plugin
  - DEC-20260123-181348: Revolution "turbo charges" Evolution (same goals)
  - DEC-20260123-182358: Lightweight inline orchestrator agent in plugin
    → CLAUDE.md should be minimal bootstrap only
    → Orchestration logic lives in plugin, not CLAUDE.md

  Now READY to proceed.
