description: |
  Define Context Graph schema for TMS-aligned operations:
  - Node types (ARTIFACT, ACTOR_HUMAN, ACTOR_AI, SYSTEM)
  - Edge types (relationships between nodes)
  - TMS operations (locate, route, retrieve, refresh, discover, invalidate)
objective: "Context Graph schema defined with TMS operation mappings"
rationale: "Externalises transactive memory for human-AI coordination"

  Completed 14 January 2026.
  Created implementation/schema_context-graph.md with:

  Node Types:
  - ARTIFACT: Documents, decisions, observations, tasks, ADRs
  - ACTOR_HUMAN: Human participants with expertise and roles
  - ACTOR_AI: AI actors with capability profiles and reliability metrics
  - SYSTEM: External systems and services

  Edge Types:
  - Information relationships: DERIVES_FROM, REFERENCES, SUPERSEDES, REQUIRES, BLOCKS, INFORMS
  - Actor-Artifact: CREATED, OWNS, CONTRIBUTED, KNOWS, CURATES
  - Actor-Actor: DELEGATES_TO, ESCALATES_TO, COLLABORATES_WITH, SUPERVISES
  - System: STORED_IN, INTEGRATES, MIRRORS

  TMS Operations (Wegner-aligned):
  - locate(query) → Directory lookup
  - route(new_info) → Allocation routing
  - retrieve(node_id) → Content retrieval (delegates to SH-002 resolver)
  - refresh(node_id) → Maintenance/staleness check
  - discover(actor, domain) → Actor expertise discovery
  - invalidate(node_id) → Mark as stale with optional cascade

  Storage: Filesystem + YAML (per SH-004 decision), designed for graph DB evolution
