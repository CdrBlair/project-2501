type: CAPABILITY
phase: 7
priority: MEDIUM
description: |
  Operationalise Phase 7 (Deployment & Maintenance) guidance and capability flows.

  Phase characteristics:
  - Information composition: 55% formal, 30% tacit, 15% emergent
  - Key capabilities: Transform, Validate, Preserve, Decide
  - Collaboration patterns: AI-Led, Partnership (for decisions)
  - Key outputs: Deployment packages, runbooks, incident responses

  Tasks:
  1. Define Phase 7 processes in framework-manual.md:
     - PROC-7.1: Deployment Preparation
     - PROC-7.2: Release Validation
     - PROC-7.3: Incident Response
     - PROC-7.4: Maintenance Planning
  2. Specify capability instances, roles, patterns, triggers
  3. Create/update AI configuration for Phase 7 behaviour

objective: "Phase 7 guidance and capability flows operationalised"
rationale: |
  Deployment requires careful coordination of automated and manual steps.
  Maintenance involves ongoing theory-building about system behaviour.

  Created 19 January 2026 as placeholder.

  COMPLETED 20 January 2026:
  - Created PROC-7.1 (Deployment Preparation)
  - Created PROC-7.2 (Release Validation)
  - Created PROC-7.3 (Incident Response)
  - Created PROC-7.4 (Maintenance Planning)
  - Created plugin/rules/phase7-deployment.md for AI behaviour
  - All processes follow QUICK/FULL modes per PRI-001
  - Returning to more tacit content (30%) as operational knowledge accumulates
  - Partnership pattern prominent for incident diagnosis and maintenance
  - Human-Led reserved for deployment approval and go-live decisions
