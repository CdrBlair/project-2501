  Investigate the emergent knowledge percentage claims in I-2 (Phase Composition).

  Current claims:
  - Phase 1: 20% emergent (highest)
  - All other phases: 10% emergent (constant)

  Questions to explore:
  1. Is emergent knowledge actually higher in Phase 1, or just more *recognised*?
  2. Is the 10% constant across phases empirically grounded or placeholder?
  3. Is "emergent" distinct enough from "tacit" to warrant separate tracking?
  4. What are implications if emergent percentages are significantly different?

  Outcome: Either validate current percentages with reasoning, revise them,
  or explicitly mark as speculative placeholders.
objective: "I-2 emergent percentages validated, revised, or explicitly marked as uncertain"
rationale: |
  Grey area identified in analysis. Framework presents percentages with more
  confidence than evidence warrants. Appropriate epistemic marking needed.

  Created 14 January 2026 from Phase 1-2 analysis.
  Lower priority than exemplars but matters for framework credibility.
