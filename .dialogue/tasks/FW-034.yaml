description: |
  Implement capability to bootstrap the framework in an existing project by extracting information from: project artefacts, linked resources, and user knowledge. Build up the context graph incrementally, validating discoveries with the user along the way.
objective: "AI can onboard to an existing project by systematically extracting and validating context"
rationale: |
  Projects adopting the framework mid-flight need a way to populate the context graph from existing knowledge rather than starting empty
