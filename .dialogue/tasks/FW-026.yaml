description: |
  Create explicit linkage between the claude-plugin-rev plugin and the
  dialogue-framework-revolution.md document.

  ## Relationship Model

  Unidirectional flow: concepts → docs → build → plugin

  The plugin references 'Revolution' as a documentation concept only.
  The revolution document points toward the plugin as a build output.
  The plugin does not back-reference the revolution document.

  ## Files

  - Plugin: claude-plugin-rev/ (currently empty scaffold)
  - Revolution document: dialogue-framework-revolution.md (project root)

  ## Current State

  - claude-plugin-rev/ exists but contains only empty README.md
  - dialogue-framework-revolution.md exists (pending completion per FW-022)

  ## Tasks

  1. Complete dialogue-framework-revolution.md (depends on FW-022)
  2. Build out claude-plugin-rev/ structure
  3. Add forward reference from revolution doc to plugin (as build output)
  4. Ensure plugin references 'Revolution' concept in appropriate documentation
  5. Verify unidirectional relationship is clear and navigable

objective: "Clear, unidirectional relationship: revolution doc → plugin"
rationale: |
  The plugin is a build output of the framework development process.
  The revolution document captures the development trajectory and should
  point forward to its outputs. The plugin references concepts but doesn't
  back-reference source documents.

  Mirrors FW-025 (evolution doc → claude-plugin-evo) but for the revolution
  variant. Lower priority as both the doc and plugin are pending work.
