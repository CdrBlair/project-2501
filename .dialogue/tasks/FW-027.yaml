  Design and implement analytics, debug mode, and instrumentation for the
  framework to support observability, troubleshooting, and continuous improvement.

  ## Scope

  ### Metrics
  - Execution metrics (skill invocations, durations, outcomes)
  - Decision/observation logging rates
  - Task throughput and cycle times
  - Assessment scores over time (links to FW-023)
  - Phase transition events

  ### Execution Logs
  - Structured logging of framework operations
  - Audit trail for compliance and debugging
  - schema_execution-log.md already exists as foundation
  - Integration with dialogue log structure

  ### Debug Mode
  - Verbose output for troubleshooting
  - Step-through or trace capability for complex flows
  - Visibility into framework decision points
  - Enable/disable via configuration

  ### Instrumentation
  - Hook points for metrics collection
  - Event emission for external monitoring
  - Performance profiling hooks
  - Extension points for custom instrumentation

  ## Design Questions

  1. What granularity of metrics is useful vs noisy?
  2. How to balance debug verbosity with usability?
  3. Where should metrics/logs be stored? (.dialogue/metrics/?)
  4. How to surface analytics without overwhelming?
  5. Integration with existing logging (decisions, observations)?

objective: "Observable, debuggable framework with actionable analytics"
rationale: |
  Framework self-hosting requires visibility into operations. Debug mode
  supports troubleshooting. Analytics enable continuous improvement and
  validation of framework effectiveness. Instrumentation enables future
  extensions.
