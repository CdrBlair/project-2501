title: "Phase 1 Capability Flow Operationalisation"
status: READY

type: CAPABILITY
phase: 1
priority: HIGH
description: |
  Operationalise Phase 1 capability flows in framework-manual.md and AI configuration.

  REVISED APPROACH: Same principle as SH-008. Outputs should be operational,
  not example documents.

  Tasks:
  1. Define Phase 1 processes in framework-manual.md:
     - PROC-1.1: Opportunity Identification
     - PROC-1.2: Stakeholder Alignment
     - PROC-1.3: Problem Framing
     - PROC-1.4: Business Case Development
  2. For each process, specify in framework-manual.md:
     - Capability instances (mostly Elicit, Synthesise, Decide)
     - Functional roles (Facilitator, Scribe per I-3 FW-007)
     - Actor patterns (Human-Only, Human-Led)
     - Escalation triggers
     - Completion criteria
  3. Create/update AI configuration:
     - Skills for Phase 1 elicitation (dialogue-structured-elicit already exists)
     - Agent behaviour rules for tacit-heavy phases
     - Hooks or prompts that activate Facilitator/Scribe roles

  Key insight: Phase 1 is heavily Elicit/Synthesise/Decide, not Transform/Generate/Preserve.
objective: "Phase 1 capability flows operationalised in framework-manual.md and AI config"
rationale: |
  Companion to SH-008. Capability flows operationalise how work happens;
  the output should be guidance practitioners use and AI configuration that
  implements the behaviour, not an example document.

  Created 14 January 2026 from Phase 1-2 analysis.
  REVISED 14 January 2026: Changed from "create exemplar" to "operationalise flows".
  FW-007 completed: functional roles now defined in I-3.
