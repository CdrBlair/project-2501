  Document the Human-Only handoff mechanism for true Human-Only steps
  where AI exits the dialogue entirely.

  Per DEC-20260120-174641, Human-Only means:
  - AI creates a blocking task
  - AI exits the dialogue
  - Process pauses until human returns with required information

  Tasks:
  1. Define blocking task structure:
     - Responsible party (who)
     - Required information/output (what)
     - Expected activities (how - workshop, meeting, review)
     - Downstream dependencies (blocks what)
     - Re-entry point (where to resume)
     - Deadline/SLA (when)

  2. Document re-entry mechanism:
     - How human signals completion
     - How process resumes
     - Validation of human-provided output

  3. Create example Human-Only steps:
     - "Conduct stakeholder workshop"
     - "Obtain executive sign-off"
     - "Hold team retrospective"

  4. Update schema documentation:
     - Clarify C1 constraint applies to true Human-Only
     - Add guidance on when to use Human-Only vs Human-Led

objective: "Clear mechanism for AI to hand off to human for external activities"
rationale: |
  Human-Only should mean AI steps away completely. This enables proper
  separation between:
  - Human-Led: AI present, recording human input
  - Human-Only: AI exits, human works externally, returns with output

  Without this mechanism, Human-Only has no operational meaning distinct
  from Human-Led.
