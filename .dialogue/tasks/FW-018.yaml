  Document the Human-Only handoff mechanism for true Human-Only steps
  where AI exits the dialogue entirely.

  Per DEC-20260120-174641, Human-Only means:
  - AI creates a blocking task
  - AI exits the dialogue
  - Process pauses until human returns with required information

  Tasks:
  1. Define blocking task structure:
     - Responsible party (who)
     - Required information/output (what)
     - Expected activities (how - workshop, meeting, review)
     - Downstream dependencies (blocks what)
     - Re-entry point (where to resume)
     - Deadline/SLA (when)

  2. Document re-entry mechanism:
     - How human signals completion
     - How process resumes
     - Validation of human-provided output

  3. Create example Human-Only steps:
     - "Conduct stakeholder workshop"
     - "Obtain executive sign-off"
     - "Hold team retrospective"

  4. Update schema documentation:
     - Clarify C1 constraint applies to true Human-Only
     - Add guidance on when to use Human-Only vs Human-Led

objective: "Clear mechanism for AI to hand off to human for external activities"
rationale: |
  Human-Only should mean AI steps away completely. This enables proper
  separation between:
  - Human-Led: AI present, recording human input
  - Human-Only: AI exits, human works externally, returns with output

  Without this mechanism, Human-Only has no operational meaning distinct
  from Human-Led.

notes: |
  COMPLETED 20 January 2026:

  1. Created plugin/references/human-only-handoff.md:
     - Full blocking task YAML structure
     - AI behaviour at Human-Only steps
     - Re-entry mechanism (human signals, AI validates, process resumes)
     - Three detailed examples: stakeholder workshop, executive sign-off, team retrospective
     - Schema constraint C1 clarification
     - Decision guide: Human-Only vs Human-Led
     - Process executor integration notes

  2. Updated implementation/schema_process-definition.md:
     - Clarified Pattern table with Human-Only distinction
     - Added note about DEC-20260120-174641
     - Cross-referenced handoff mechanism document

  3. Updated concepts/concept_collaboration-patterns.md:
     - Updated Human-Only row in patterns table
     - Added "Human-Only Handoff Mechanism" section
     - Documented the distinguishing factors and decision rule
     - Cross-referenced operational details
