type: CAPABILITY
phase: 1
priority: HIGH
description: |
  Operationalise Phase 1 (Initiation) guidance and capability flows.

  Phase characteristics:
  - Information composition: 20% formal, 50% tacit, 30% emergent
  - Key capabilities: Elicit, Synthesise, Decide
  - Collaboration patterns: Human-Only, Human-Led
  - Key outputs: Project charter, stakeholder map, problem statement

  Tasks:
  1. Define Phase 1 processes in framework-manual.md:
     - PROC-1.1: Opportunity Identification
     - PROC-1.2: Stakeholder Alignment
     - PROC-1.3: Problem Framing
     - PROC-1.4: Business Case Development
  2. Specify capability instances, roles, patterns, triggers
  3. Create/update AI configuration for Phase 1 behaviour

  Key insight: Phase 1 is heavily tacit/emergent. AI role is primarily
  Facilitator/Scribe (elicitation support), not autonomous execution.

objective: "Phase 1 guidance and capability flows operationalised"
rationale: |
  Initiation establishes project foundation through tacit knowledge elicitation.
  AI assists but cannot lead in this phase.

  Created 19 January 2026 - consolidated from SH-008 and SH-009.

  20 January 2026: COMPLETED
  - SH-008 (Operational Guidance): COMPLETED (14 Jan)
  - SH-009 (Capability Flow): COMPLETED (20 Jan)

  Deliverables:
  - PROC-1.1: process-opportunity-identification.yaml
  - PROC-1.2: process-stakeholder-alignment.yaml
  - PROC-1.3: process-problem-framing.yaml
  - PROC-1.4: process-business-case.yaml
  - plugin/rules/phase1-initiation.md

  Key principle established (DEC-20260120-114214):
  Progressive Value Delivery - prioritise quick meaningful output over
  strict phase completion. QUICK/FULL modes, deferred items, learn-by-doing.
