description: |
  Extend dialogue-log-decision skill to support DESIGN type decisions:
  - Add DESIGN as valid type (between TACTICAL and ADR)
  - DESIGN requires rationale and context fields (not optional)
  - Update skill documentation with type selection guidance
  - Update underlying script to validate DESIGN requirements
  Framework grounding: DESIGN maps to STR domain, Dynamic-Standing temporal class,
  elicitable knowledge with rationale capture.
objective: "Decision logging skill supports OPERATIONAL, TACTICAL, and DESIGN types"
rationale: "Gap identified: schema simplification decision was more than tactical but less than ADR"

  Completed 14 January 2026.
  - Added DESIGN and ADR types to log-decision.sh script
  - DESIGN/ADR require rationale AND context (validated by script)
  - Added ref parameter for ADR cross-referencing
  - Updated SKILL.md with type selection flowchart and examples
  - Tested: DEC-20260114-102417 logged as DESIGN type
  Decision types mapped to framework concepts:
  - OPERATIONAL: WRK domain, Ephemeral, documentable knowledge
  - TACTICAL: WRK domain, Ephemeral-Dynamic, elicitable knowledge
  - DESIGN: STR domain, Dynamic-Standing, elicitable with rationale
  - ADR: STR domain, Standing, formal alternatives analysis
