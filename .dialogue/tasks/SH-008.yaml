  Operationalise Phase 1 guidance in framework-manual.md and AI configuration.

  REVISED APPROACH: Examples are not useful outputs. Either they're drafts awaiting
  promotion, or experiments to be analysed and discarded. Real outputs should be:
  1. Updates to framework-manual.md (operational reference practitioners use)
  2. Updates to AI configuration (skills, agents, rules that guide behaviour)

  Tasks:
  1. Extract insights from draft example_phase1-document-type-registry.md
  2. Update framework-manual.md with Phase 1 operational guidance:
     - Document types (what to capture, not ceremony)
     - Straw man pattern (placeholders are valid)
     - Scaling guidance (minimal vs full Phase 1)
     - Collaboration patterns (Human-Only, Human-Led)
     - Functional roles (Facilitator, Scribe high-value per I-3)
  3. Create/update skills or agents for Phase 1 behaviour
  4. Archive or delete example file once insights absorbed

  Key insights to preserve:
  - 75% tacit composition means AI assists but cannot lead
  - Straw man documents make assumptions explicit and trackable
  - Process references trace lineage, not mandate ceremony
  - Capture windows critical for ephemeral documents
objective: "Phase 1 guidance operationalised in framework-manual.md and AI config"
rationale: |
  Examples without consumers are dead documents. The real outputs are:
  - framework-manual.md updates (where practitioners look)
  - AI configuration (what actually implements behaviour)
  Insight from user: "either it is a draft awaiting review, or it is an experiment
  to be analyzed and accepted/discarded."

  Created 14 January 2026 from Phase 1-2 analysis.
  REVISED 14 January 2026: Changed from "create exemplar" to "operationalise guidance".

  Completed 14 January 2026:
  - Analysed capability registry for actor implementation approach
  - Extracted operational guidance from draft example_phase1-document-type-registry.md
  - Updated framework-manual.md v1.2 with Phase 1 operational guidance:
    * Information composition and implications
    * Collaboration pattern constraints
    * Functional roles (Facilitator, Scribe high-value)
    * Scaling guidance (minimal vs full)
    * Straw man pattern documentation
    * Capture window criticality
    * Rationale-first validation checklist
    * AI configuration guidance
  - Created .claude/rules/phase1-initiation.md for standing behaviour rules
  - Extended dialogue-structured-elicit skill with Phase 1-specific elicitation guidance
  - Archived draft to research/archived/ (DEC-20260114-173830)

  Key insight operationalised: Actors aren't implemented as a separate system—
  they're emergent from rules, skills, and prompts that activate roles.
