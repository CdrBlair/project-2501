  Create dialogue-manage-work-items skill for task CRUD operations.
  Approach: Treat as editing problem, not scripting problem.
  - Move schema into skill directory (self-contained)
  - AI reads YAML, understands schema, edits directly
  - No shell script needed
  Operations to support:
  - Create new task (with next ID generation)
  - Update task status/fields
  - List tasks (with optional filters)
  - Archive completed items
objective: "Skill enables AI to manage tasks via direct YAML editing"
rationale: "task management is fundamentally editing; scripts add unnecessary complexity"

  Completed 14 January 2026.
  Created .claude/skills/dialogue-manage-work-items/SKILL.md with:

  Design decision: No script approach.
  - YAML is human-readable and AI-editable
  - Schema embedded in skill provides context for correct edits
  - Simpler than maintaining shell script for YAML manipulation

  Skill contents:
  - Full schema reference (fields, types, enums)
  - Operation guides (create, update, list, add notes)
  - Validation checklist
  - TodoWrite relationship explained
  - TMS alignment noted
