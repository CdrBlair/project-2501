  Address unmodelled AI capability evolution in THY-003 and F-2.

  Current position: Human-AI TMS asymmetry exists because "AI context is ephemeral"
  and bounded by session/context window.

  Unaddressed: What happens as context windows expand (4K → 200K+ and growing)?
  Does this change the asymmetry analysis? When does it become qualitatively different?

  Tasks:
  1. Model how asymmetry changes with context window size
  2. Identify thresholds where qualitative shifts might occur
  3. Maintain temporal qualification (as of 2024-2025) while acknowledging trajectory
  4. Update F-2 or THY-003 with evolution considerations

  Framework temporally qualifies AI claims but doesn't model evolution trajectory.
objective: "F-2/THY-003 updated with AI context evolution considerations"
rationale: |
  Framework risks becoming dated if it doesn't acknowledge AI capability trajectories.
  Not about predicting the future but acknowledging known directions of change.

  Lower priority; current framing is defensible for now.
