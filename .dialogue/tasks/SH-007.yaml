  - Option A: Retrofit existing documents with frontmatter
  - Option B: Create forward-only with new artifacts
  - Option C: Hybrid (retrofit key documents, forward for new)

  Completed 14 January 2026.
  Decision: Hybrid approach (Option C).
  ADR-002: Hybrid Approach for Existing Artifact Treatment
  DEC-20260114-115231: Cross-reference in decision log

  Key points:
  - New documents use full conventions (THY/REF/STR prefixes, frontmatter)
  - Existing concept documents remain as-is
  - THY-001 and REF-001 serve as bridge documents
  - Future retrofit can be done incrementally
