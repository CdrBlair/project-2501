  Draft design for auto-committing decision/observation logs and reminding users to pull
objective: "Ensure logs are visible to team promptly, supporting transactive memory"

  Created 21 January 2026.

  Design scope:
  - Hook options: PostToolUse on log-decision/log-observation skills
  - Commit granularity: individual vs batched commits
  - User notification: remind to pull at session start
  - Merge conflict mitigation: YAML files with unique timestamps
  - Consider SessionStart hook for pull reminder
  - Consider Stop hook for commit reminder
