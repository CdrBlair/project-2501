description: |
  Define concrete formats for foundational project knowledge documents. Consider structure like .dialogue/project/{vision|objectives|principles|constraints}.md. Determine how these documents link to the context graph and how they are populated (bootstrap vs manual).
objective: "Standardised location and format for core project knowledge that AI can reliably reference"
rationale: |
  Foundational project knowledge (vision, objectives, principles) should have a known location and structure rather than being scattered or implicit
