description: |
  Implement audit trail linking execution logs to process definitions.

  Requirements:
  - Process instance ID generation
  - Link from execution log entries to process instance
  - Link from process instance to process definition
  - Support "what happened and why" queries

  May involve ProcessManifest artefact that captures:
  - Process definition (inline or reference)
  - Instance parameters
  - Execution log entry references

objective: "Full audit trail from execution back to process definition"
rationale: "Auditability requirement identified in design discussion"
