type: DOCUMENT
priority: HIGH
description: |
  The current help and instructions are too literal and concept-focused. While grounding in framework concepts is partially correct, the documentation fails to guide users through how to use the framework effectively in practice.
objective: "Create a great user experience where new users understand what Dialogue offers within minutes, can find the right skill/command easily, and documentation answers 'how do I...' questions"
rationale: |
  User experience is critical for adoption. Current documentation explains 'what' but not 'how', making the framework feel like studying a manual rather than an intuitive tool.
