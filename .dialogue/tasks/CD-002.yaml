description: |
  Address measurement gap for tacit-heavy phases identified in analysis.

  C-7 (Phase-Aware Measurement) states early phases require qualitative assessment
  of "stakeholder alignment", "shared understanding", "problem framing adequacy"
  but provides no operationalisation.

  Tasks:
  1. Review Ryan & O'Connor's Team Tacit Knowledge Measure for Phase 1-2 applicability
  2. Identify or develop indicators for stakeholder alignment
  3. Create checklist for problem framing adequacy assessment
  4. Link measurement approaches to existing evidence base (Meyer good days, Obi bad days)
  5. Update C-7 with operationalised guidance or acknowledge gap explicitly

  Later phases have DORA, SPACE, DevEx. Early phases need equivalent.
objective: "C-7 updated with operationalised Phase 1-2 measurement or explicit gap acknowledgement"
rationale: |
  Framework claims Phase 1-2 are most critical but provides least measurement
  guidance. This undermines practical application and creates internal inconsistency.

notes: |
  Created 14 January 2026 from Phase 1-2 analysis.
  May result in "gap remains open" if no valid instruments exist,
  but that should be explicit rather than implicit.
