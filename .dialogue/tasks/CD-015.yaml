  Analyse Phase 1-3 documents for consistency with updated C-6 and C-7.

  ## Context

  C-6 (Transitions & Information Loss) and C-7 (Phase-Aware Measurement) were
  significantly updated on 20 January 2026:

  **C-6 additions:**
  - Phase-Specific Mitigation Strategies section
  - Early-phase mitigations mapped to document domains (STR, THY, HST, WRK)
  - PRDs identified as early-phase equivalent to ADRs
  - Mitigation effectiveness estimates by knowledge type
  - Implementation guidance (5 principles)

  **C-7 additions:**
  - Early-Phase Measurement Operationalisation section
  - Stakeholder Alignment Assessment (5-dimension survey)
  - Shared Understanding Indicators (TTKM adaptation)
  - Problem Framing Adequacy Checklist (6 elements)
  - Leading Experience Indicators (Meyer/Obi adaptation)
  - Practical Assessment Approaches

  ## Phase Documents to Review

  - claude-plugin-evo/rules/phase1-initiation.md
  - claude-plugin-evo/rules/phase2-planning.md
  - claude-plugin-evo/rules/phase3-analysis.md

  ## Analysis Required

  For each phase document:
  1. Does it reference appropriate C-6 mitigation strategies?
  2. Does it reference appropriate C-7 measurement approaches?
  3. Are there contradictions or inconsistencies with updated concepts?
  4. Are there opportunities to strengthen phase guidance with new content?
  5. Do the phase documents need explicit links to new sections?

  ## Specific Checks

  **Phase 1 (Initiation):**
  - Should reference PRDs as rationale-capture mechanism
  - Should reference stakeholder alignment assessment
  - Should reference problem framing checklist

  **Phase 2 (Planning):**
  - Should reference decision logging for decision history preservation
  - Should reference assumptions logging
  - Should reference Initiation→Planning mitigation strategies

  **Phase 3 (Analysis):**
  - Should reference Planning→Analysis mitigation strategies
  - Should reference shared understanding indicators
  - Should reference requirements consistency testing

objective: "Phase 1-3 documents aligned with updated C-6/C-7 content"
rationale: |
  Concept documents were updated but downstream phase guidance may now be
  inconsistent or miss opportunities to reference new operational content.
  Framework coherence requires phase documents to reflect concept updates.

notes: |
  Created 20 January 2026 following C-6/C-7 updates (CD-002, CD-003).

  This is conceptual debt introduced by updating concepts without updating
  all downstream documents that depend on them.

  - Added Stakeholder Alignment Assessment (5 dimensions)
  - Added Rationale Capture section (PRDs, log-decision, log-observation)
  - Added Phase Transition Readiness (/assess-phase reference)
  - Added C-6/C-7 concept references

  Updated phase2-planning.md:
  - Added Decision Logging section with decision types
  - Added Assumptions Logging section
  - Added Mitigation from Initiation section
  - Added Planning Quality Indicators table
  - Added Phase Transition Readiness section
  - Added C-6/C-7 concept references

  Updated phase3-analysis.md:
