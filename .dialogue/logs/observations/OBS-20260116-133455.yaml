subject: "Stop hook behaviour difference hypothesis"
value: "Prompt hooks wrap reason in 'Prompt hook condition was not met: X' while command hooks pass reason directly. Both inject as meta user messages via same mechanism (iq0 function). Hypothesis: wrapper changes pragmatics - I treat wrapped version as error notification vs direct instruction. Needs behavioural validation."
