title: "Clarify Human-Only pattern as strict external handoff"

context: |
  During Phase 2 validation, schema constraint C1 (Human-Only → ai_role = "None")
  flagged violations across all Phase 1 and Phase 2 processes. Steps marked Human-Only
  had ai_role describing recording/structuring functions.

  This revealed a conceptual ambiguity: what does "Human-Only" actually mean?

decision: |
  Human-Only pattern means AI exits the dialogue entirely and creates a blocking
  handoff. The process pauses until the human returns with required information.

  Steps where AI remains present to record human input should be Human-Led, not
  Human-Only. The distinction:

  - Human-Only: AI creates task, exits, waits for human to return with output
  - Human-Led: AI present, human provides substance, AI records/structures

rationale: |
  1. "Recording" is exercising the Preserve capability - that's AI involvement
  2. True Human-Only should mean activities outside the AI dialogue
  3. Cleaner separation enables proper handoff mechanism design
  4. Resolves schema constraint C1 violations systematically

implications:
  - All current "Human-Only" steps in PROC-1.x and PROC-2.x become Human-Led
  - ai_role updated to describe recording function explicitly
  - Need to document Human-Only handoff mechanism (task creation, re-entry)
  - True Human-Only reserved for external activities (workshops, meetings, approvals)
