type: TACTICAL
actor: "human:pidster"
subject: "Information reference schema approach"
outcome: "Simplified from URI format to self-describing IDs - patterns determine type without scheme prefixes"
rationale: "Simpler format reduces cognitive load, maintains backward compatibility, defers resolver complexity to SH-002"
context: "Initial v1 had complex URI format; user directed simplification following principle of minimal necessary complexity"
