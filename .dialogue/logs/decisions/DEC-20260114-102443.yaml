type: ADR
actor: "human:pidster"
subject: "Decision type hierarchy for framework logging"
outcome: "Created ADR-001"
rationale: "The four-tier model provides complete coverage while maintaining clear boundaries. Each type maps to framework concepts (document domains, temporal classes, knowledge types), providing theoretical grounding for the distinctions."
context: "The framework needed a way to classify and log decisions at different levels of significance. The existing OPERATIONAL/TACTICAL types were insufficient for design decisions that don't warrant full ADRs."
