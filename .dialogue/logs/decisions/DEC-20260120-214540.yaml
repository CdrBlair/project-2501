actor: "human:pidster"
subject: "C-6 Phase-Specific Mitigation Strategies"
outcome: "Added comprehensive phase-specific mitigation section to C-6 covering early, middle, and late phases with explicit document domain mappings and implementation examples"
rationale: "Early phases had no equivalent mitigation guidance to ADRs for middle phases; PRDs identified as analogous rationale-capture mechanism; dialogue skills referenced as implementation tools"
context: "Addresses CD-003 conceptual debt; integrates PRD best practices with framework document domains (STR, THY, HST, WRK)"
