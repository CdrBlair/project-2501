subject: "C-7 Early-Phase Measurement Operationalisation"
outcome: "Added comprehensive operationalisation section covering stakeholder alignment assessment, shared understanding indicators, problem framing checklist, and leading experience indicators"
rationale: "C-7 listed metrics but provided no operationalisation; Ryan & O'Connor TTKM provides validated foundation; Gartner stakeholder alignment research provides industry practice; Meyer/Obi developer experience research provides adaptable indicators"
context: "Addresses CD-002 conceptual debt; integrates TTKM, Gartner alignment research, and Meyer/Obi experience indicators into practical assessment approaches"
