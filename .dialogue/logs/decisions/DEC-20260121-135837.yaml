type: DESIGN
actor: "human:pidster"
subject: "Traceability edge types v1"
outcome: "Add ASM artifact type; node-per-file for implementations; defer negative edges (CONTRADICTS, RISKS) to later; defer PARTIALLY_SATISFIES pending quantifiability question"
rationale: "Start simple, add complexity when needed; satisfaction quantifiability uncertain"
