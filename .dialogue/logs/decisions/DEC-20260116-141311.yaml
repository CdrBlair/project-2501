type: DESIGN
actor: "human:pidster"
subject: "Stop hook architecture"
outcome: "Use command-based stop-loop-guard.sh instead of prompt-based hook"
rationale: "Diagnostic testing revealed prompt hooks don't receive conversation transcript, only metadata including transcript_path"
context: "Command-based hooks can read the transcript file if needed; simple loop-guard pattern provides reliable stop behavior without complex evaluation"
tags: ["hooks", "architecture", "stop-hook"]
