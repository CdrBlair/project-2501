type: DESIGN
actor: "human:pidster"
subject: "Stop hook compliance checking approach"
outcome: "Always use prompt evaluation with loop guard; defer fast-path optimisation"
rationale: "Avoid premature optimisation; prompt evaluation provides intelligent context-aware checking that simple markers cannot replicate"
context: "Explored hybrid approach with env var markers but deferred due to complexity around multiple decisions/observations per turn"
tags: ["hooks", "stop", "compliance"]
