actor: "human:pidster"
subject: "Plugin self-containment architecture"
outcome: "Plugin must be independently deployable with all operational content embedded; host project produces the plugin as a build artifact"
rationale: "Plugin portability requires no external dependencies on host project files. The framework manual and operational content are distilled/copied from source (implementation/, concepts/) into plugin/references/. External links to build artefacts are elided. This enables the plugin to be deployed to other projects without requiring the full framework development repository."
context: "Triggered by need for plugin to operate correctly without external links"
