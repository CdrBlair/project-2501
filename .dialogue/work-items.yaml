      Created schema_information-reference.md (Version 2 - simplified):
      - Self-describing IDs: pattern determines type (no scheme prefixes needed)
      - Document patterns: THY-NNN, REF-NNN, STR-NNN, F-N, C-N, O-N, I-N, G-N, E-N
      - Timestamp patterns: DEC-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS, OBS-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
      - Work item patterns: SH-NNN, CD-NNN, FW-NNN
      - Actor patterns: human:<id>, ai:<id>
      - Version suffix: @vN, Fragment suffix: #section
      - Relationship types aligned with document frontmatter schema
      - Resolution deferred to SH-002 (location-agnostic design)

    description: |
      Extend dialogue-log-decision skill to support DESIGN type decisions:
      - Add DESIGN as valid type (between TACTICAL and ADR)
      - DESIGN requires rationale and context fields (not optional)
      - Update skill documentation with type selection guidance
      - Update underlying script to validate DESIGN requirements
      Framework grounding: DESIGN maps to STR domain, Dynamic-Standing temporal class,
      elicitable knowledge with rationale capture.
    objective: "Decision logging skill supports OPERATIONAL, TACTICAL, and DESIGN types"
    rationale: "Gap identified: schema simplification decision was more than tactical but less than ADR"

      Decision types mapped to framework concepts:

      - TACTICAL: WRK domain, Ephemeral-Dynamic, elicitable knowledge
      - DESIGN: STR domain, Dynamic-Standing, elicitable with rationale

      Create dialogue-create-adr skill for Architecture Decision Records:
      - Use template from guidance_implementation.md (Context, Decision, Alternatives, Consequences, Rationale)
      - Store ADRs as Standing documents in decisions/ directory (ADR-NNN-<title>.md)
      - Automatically create decision log entry with type=ADR and ref to ADR file
      - Support status lifecycle (Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated → Superseded)
      Framework grounding: ADRs are STR domain, Standing temporal class,
      attempting to capture embedded knowledge through formal alternatives analysis.
    objective: "ADR skill creates Standing decision documents with decision log cross-reference"
    rationale: "ADRs require more structure than log entries; cross-reference ensures decision log is complete audit trail"

      Key design decision (DEC-20260114-101710): ADR creation must also create
      decision log entry to maintain decision log as source of truth.
