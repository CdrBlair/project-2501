# Research

This directory contains integration analyses, exploratory research documents, and supporting materials that inform the AI-Augmented SDLC Framework but are not primary sources (PDFs) or companion analyses.

## Index

### Reference Materials

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [reference-library-quality-annotated.md](./reference-library-quality-annotated.md) | Annotated bibliography with quality tier assessments for all reference sources |
| [reference-library-standards-update.md](./reference-library-standards-update.md) | Analysis of standards evolution and current status (ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, etc.) |

### Research Documents

| Document | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| [naur-wegner-integration-research.md](./naur-wegner-integration-research.md) | Original integration analysis connecting Naur's theory-building with Wegner's transactive memory | **(Superseded)** — Migrated to [`concepts/integration_naur-wegner.md`](../concepts/integration_naur-wegner.md) |
| [tacit-knowledge-software-failure.md](./tacit-knowledge-software-failure.md) | Analysis of how tacit knowledge loss contributes to software project failures | Active |
| [planning-future-work.md](./planning-future-work.md) | Tracking document for future development directions | Active |

### Archived Investigations

| Document | Description | Formalised To |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| [archive/investigation-decision-observation-tracking.md](./archive/investigation-decision-observation-tracking.md) | Design for recording observations and decisions throughout the SDLC | [`concepts/concept_decision-observation-tracking.md`](../concepts/concept_decision-observation-tracking.md) |
| [archive/investigation-work-coordination.md](./archive/investigation-work-coordination.md) | Design for coordinating work between human and AI actors | [`concepts/concept_work-coordination.md`](../concepts/concept_work-coordination.md) |

*Archived investigations retain implementation-level detail (tooling options, storage technologies, architecture diagrams) useful for Phase D executable framework work.*

## Purpose

Documents in this directory serve several purposes:

1. **Integration Analyses**: Documents that synthesise multiple sources to develop novel insights
2. **Exploratory Research**: Working analyses that may inform framework development
3. **Archived Originals**: Earlier versions of documents that have been migrated elsewhere but retained for reference

## Relationship to Other Directories

| Directory | Contains | Relationship |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| `papers/` | PDFs and companion analyses | Primary sources and their detailed analyses |
| `concepts/` | Framework documents | Mature, integrated framework components |
| `research/` | Integration and exploratory work | Supporting analyses that inform framework development |

---

*This directory provides a home for research documents that don't fit the companion analysis format but contribute to framework development.*
