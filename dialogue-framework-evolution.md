# The Dialogue Framework: Evolution

## Incremental AI Adoption from Current Practice

---

## Overview

**Evolution** is the first of two meta-processes defined by The Dialogue Framework. It provides guidance for organisations adopting AI-augmented development incrementally—adding AI capabilities to existing workflows while preserving team knowledge, organisational structures, and established practices.

### When to Use Evolution

- Existing development practices are effective and well-understood
- Team tacit knowledge and transactive memory systems are valuable assets
- Organisational risk tolerance favours gradual change
- AI integration should enhance rather than disrupt current workflows

---

## Principles

*To be developed*

1. **Preserve what works**: Existing practices embody accumulated learning
2. **Augment, don't replace**: AI assists human capabilities
3. **Maintain knowledge continuity**: Protect tacit knowledge and TMS
4. **Incremental validation**: Each step validated before proceeding

## Relationship to Revolution

Evolution and Revolution are not mutually exclusive. Organisations may:
- Start with Evolution, transition to Revolution when ready
- Apply Evolution to some phases, Revolution to others
- Use Evolution as fallback when Revolution encounters resistance
