**Primary Contribution**: Nine design principles that operationalise joint optimisation

## The Nine Principles (Summary)

Based on secondary sources pending primary document access:

1. **Compatibility** — Design process must be compatible with its objectives
2. **Minimal Critical Specification** — Specify only what is essential; leave room for self-organisation
3. **Variance Control** — Variances should be controlled at source by those who experience them
4. **Boundary Location** — Boundaries should facilitate information sharing
5. **Information Flow** — Information should go where needed for action
6. **Power and Authority** — Those needing equipment and knowledge should have access
7. **Multifunctionality** — Adaptability requires multifunctional roles
8. **Support Congruence** — Support systems must reinforce sought behaviours
9. **Design and Human Values** — Quality of work life is a central design objective

## Framework Integration Points

**TO ANALYSE**:
- Mapping each principle to AI-augmented development contexts
- Tension analysis (where principles may conflict)
- Connection to Naur's theory-building (does minimal specification support theory development?)
- Connection to Wegner's transactive memory (boundary location for distributed knowledge)
- Measurement implications (can principle adherence be measured?)

## Preliminary Mapping to AI-Augmented Development

| Principle | Potential Application | Questions to Explore |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Minimal Critical Specification | Context engineering should specify intent, not procedure | How much specification is "minimal" for AI prompts? |
| Variance Control at Source | Developers closest to work should configure AI tools | Who should control AI tool parameters? |
| Boundary Location | Human-AI handoffs should enable knowledge flow | Where should human oversight occur? |
| Multifunctionality | Teams need AI-literate members who can reconfigure | What skills constitute "AI literacy"? |
| Support Congruence | Incentives must align with collaborative AI use | How do metrics change with AI integration? |

## Companion Document TODO

This companion analysis requires:

1. **Obtain primary source** — Access through institutional subscription or ILL
2. **Detailed principle analysis** — Each principle with original context and rationale
3. **Cherns 1987 comparison** — What changed in the "revisited" version
4. **Software engineering mapping** — Clegg (2000) and Baxter & Sommerville extensions
5. **AI-specific application** — Systematic mapping to human-AI work system design
6. **Validation status** — What evidence supports each principle?
