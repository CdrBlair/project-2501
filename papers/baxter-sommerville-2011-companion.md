## Source Classification

**Type**: Review and framework proposal

**Nature of Contribution**: Primary bridge paper connecting STS theory to software systems engineering

**Primary Contribution**: Proposed Socio-Technical Systems Engineering (STSE) framework; identified four research communities applying STS to software

---

## Key Themes (Preliminary)

### 1. Four Research Communities Using STS
- Work design
- Information systems
- Computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW)
- Cognitive systems engineering

### 2. The Adoption Gap
> "Socio-technical design methods are rarely used in industrial practice despite theoretical appeal"

Attributed to:
- Methodological complexity
- Disconnect from technical engineering concerns
- Difficulty integrating with existing SE practices

### 3. STSE Framework
Proposed activities:
- Sensitisation
- Awareness
- Constructive engagement

## Framework Integration Points

**TO ANALYSE**:
- Why has STS adoption been limited in software engineering?
- What does STSE add to traditional SE methods?
- Connection to Naur's theory-building (does STSE support theory development?)
- Connection to ISO 12207 processes (where does STS fit in lifecycle?)
- Implications for AI-augmented development

---

## Critical Questions

1. **Adoption failure**: If STS methods are rarely used, should we be recommending them?
2. **Methodological complexity**: Is this inherent or addressable?
3. **Integration path**: How would STS integrate with existing framework concepts?
4. **Evidence for STSE**: Has the proposed framework been validated since 2011?

---

## Companion Document TODO

This companion analysis requires:

1. **Full paper analysis** — Detailed extraction of STSE framework components
2. **Four communities deep-dive** — What each community contributes
3. **Adoption gap analysis** — Why STS hasn't been adopted and whether this is changing
4. **Post-2011 developments** — Has STSE gained traction? What evidence exists?
5. **Framework integration mapping** — How STSE connects to existing framework documents
6. **AI-era relevance** — Does 2011 analysis still apply to 2024-2025 AI integration?

## Connection to Meta-Analysis

The `foundation_sts-meta-analysis.md` document provides empirical evidence relevant to this paper:

- **Mirroring hypothesis**: 69% support overall, 83% within-firm
- **Socio-technical congruence**: 32% improvement in resolution time (Cataldo et al.)
- **Methodological limitations**: Publication bias, correlational evidence

This companion should cross-reference meta-analysis findings to assess Baxter & Sommerville's claims.
