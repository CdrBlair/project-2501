# The Dialogue Framework: Revolution

## Transformational Redesign for Human-AI Optimisation

---

## Overview

**Revolution** is the second of two meta-processes defined by The Dialogue Framework. It provides guidance for organisations fundamentally reconceiving their development work systems—applying socio-technical design principles to jointly optimise human and AI subsystems from first principles.

### When to Use Revolution

- Current practices are inadequate or unsustainable
- Greenfield opportunity (new team, new product, new organisation)
- Strategic decision to maximise AI-augmented capability
- Willingness to invest in fundamental redesign

## Principles

*To be developed*

1. **Joint optimisation**: Co-design social and technical subsystems
2. **Minimal critical specification**: Specify only what must be specified
3. **Variance control at source**: Handle problems where they arise
4. **Boundary location**: Place boundaries to facilitate dialogue
5. **Incompletion**: Design is ongoing, not one-time

## Work System Design

*To be developed*

Applying Cherns' principles and STS theory to human-AI work system design.

---

## Knowledge Architecture

*To be developed*

- Designing for theory-building in human-AI systems
- Transactive memory with AI participants
- Information flow optimisation

---

## Collaboration Pattern Design

*To be developed*

Selecting optimal patterns based on information composition, not historical practice.

---

## Transition Management

*To be developed*

- Managing the shift from current state
- Addressing resistance and uncertainty
- Building new capabilities

---

## Measurement

*To be developed*

Measuring revolutionary change—new baselines, new metrics.

---

## Relationship to Evolution

Revolution and Evolution are not mutually exclusive. Organisations may:
- Use Revolution for greenfield, Evolution for legacy
- Transition from Evolution to Revolution as capability matures
- Apply Revolution selectively to high-impact phases
